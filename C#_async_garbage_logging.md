## 1. Asynchronous Operations

### async and await Keywords

- **async keyword**: Marks a method as asynchronous.
- **await keyword**: Pauses execution until the awaited task completes, without blocking the thread.
- **Task and Task<T>**: Represent ongoing operations that will complete in the future.

### Task and Task<T>

The method which is marked with the `async` keyword must return a `Task` or `Task<T>`. The idea of a `Task` is that it represents an asynchronous operation and does not return anything. In the case of `Task<T>`, it is like a promise that in the future this method will return a value of the data type `T`.

**UI --> API -> Database:**
- You cannot explore it
- Hence do not wait to get it complete, and block the main thread
- Use `async` and `await` and move forward with different task

**UI --> API:**
- Very big independent tasks like calculations
- Use parallelism to run it simultaneously

### Example: Async Method

```csharp
public async Task<string> GetDataAsync()
{
    // Simulate an asynchronous operation (e.g., HTTP call)
    await Task.Delay(1000);
    return "Data loaded";
}
```

**Usage:**

```csharp
string result = await GetDataAsync();
```

- The method returns a `Task<string>`.
- `await` releases the thread to do other work while the task completes.

**Execution Flow:**

```csharp
public async Task MyMethodAsync()
{
    Console.WriteLine("Step 1: Before await");
    
    await Task.Delay(2000); // Simulate async work (e.g., database call)
    
    Console.WriteLine("Step 2: After await");
}
```

Output: `print before await` --> `2 sec loading` --> `print after await`

### Usage Notes

- Use `async/await` for I/O-bound operations (database, file, network).
- Avoid `async void` except for event handlers; use `async Task` or `async Task<T>`.
- Do not block on `async` code (avoid `.Result` or `.Wait()`).
- The idea is to avoid blocking a thread while waiting for a response, either from an external system such as a web service or from the computer's file management system.

## 2. Cancellation Token

You can use a `CancellationToken` to signal to a running task that it should stop executing. You can cancel a long-running Task in C# by using a `CancellationToken` and periodically checking whether cancellation has been requested within the task's logic.

### CancellationTokenSource

- It is a class implementing the `IDisposable` interface. `CancellationTokenSource` signals to a `CancellationToken` that it should be canceled.

**Constructors:**

| Constructor | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `CancellationTokenSource()` | Initializes a new instance of the `CancellationTokenSource` class. |
| `CancellationTokenSource(TimeSpan delay)` | Initializes a new instance of the `CancellationTokenSource` class that will be canceled after the specified time span. |
| `CancellationTokenSource(int millisecondsDelay)` | Initializes a new instance of the `CancellationTokenSource` class that will be canceled after the specified delay in milliseconds. |

### Properties

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `public bool IsCancellationRequested { get; }` | Gets whether cancellation has been requested for this `CancellationTokenSource`. Returns `true` if the cancellation has been requested; otherwise, `false`. |
| `public CancellationToken Token { get; }` | Gets the `CancellationToken` associated with this `CancellationTokenSource`. It will throw `ObjectDisposedException` if the token source has been disposed. |

### Methods

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Cancel()` | Communicates a request for cancellation. |
| `Cancel(bool throwOnFirstException)` | Communicates a request for cancellation and specifies whether remaining callbacks and cancellable operations should be processed if an exception occurs. The parameter `throwOnFirstException` specifies `true` if exceptions should immediately propagate; otherwise, `false`. |
| `CancelAfter(TimeSpan delay)` | Schedules a cancel operation on this `CancellationTokenSource` after the specified time span. The parameter `delay` specifies the time span to wait before canceling this `CancellationTokenSource`. |
| `CancelAfter(int millisecondsDelay)` | Schedules a cancel operation on this `CancellationTokenSource` after the specified number of milliseconds. The parameter `millisecondsDelay` specifies the time span to wait before canceling this `CancellationTokenSource`. |
| `Dispose()` | Releases all resources used by the current instance of the `CancellationTokenSource` class. |

### Example: Using CancellationToken with Database Operations

```csharp
async Task RunStoredProcedureAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken)
{
    using (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
    using (var command = new SqlCommand("myStoredProcedure", connection))
    {
        command.CommandType = CommandType.StoredProcedure;
        // Add parameters as needed

        await connection.OpenAsync(cancellationToken);
        
        // Pass the token to ExecuteReaderAsync, ExecuteNonQueryAsync, etc.
        using (var reader = await command.ExecuteReaderAsync(cancellationToken))
        {
            while (await reader.ReadAsync(cancellationToken))
            {
                // Process results
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## 3. Garbage Collection

.NET Core uses a generational GC model, which divides objects into three generations:

### Generational GC Model

| Generation | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Generation 0 (Gen 0)** | Newly allocated objects. Collection is fast and frequent. |
| **Generation 1 (Gen 1)** | Objects that survived Gen 0 collection. |
| **Generation 2 (Gen 2)** | Long-lived objects that survived multiple collections. |

### GC Process Flow

```
[App Allocates Objects] --> [Managed Heap]
            |
            v
      [GC Roots] traverse --> [Live Objects]
            |
            v
      [Mark & Compact]
            |
            v
[Unreachable Objects Freed]
```

### Explicit GC Collection

- Explicit calls to `GC.Collect()` (not recommended in most cases).

---

## 4.  (Destructor)

If a class defines a finalizer (`~MyClass()`), GC will call it before reclaiming the object's memory.

- Finalizer can be defined with `~classname()`
- Used to clear unmanaged resources
- GC is not aware about unmanaged resource (like file handles, database connections, native memory), hence need to define finalizer, which will be clearing unmanaged resources
- GC will call finalizer method before reclaiming the object

### How It Works

- The GC automatically calls the finalizer (if defined) when it determines that the object is no longer accessible.
- The timing is non-deterministic; you cannot predict exactly when the finalizer will run.
- The finalizer runs on a separate thread, not the thread that created the object.

### Example: Finalizer Implementation

```csharp
class MyClass
{
    // Finalizer
    ~MyClass()
    {
        // cleanup code for unmanaged resources
    }
}
```

### Limitations

- You cannot call a finalizer directly; it is called by the GC.
- Finalizers can delay memory reclamation because the object survives at least one GC cycle after becoming unreachable.
- If you forget to release unmanaged resources, you may cause resource leaks.

---

## 5. IDisposable

For deterministic resource cleanup, implement `IDisposable` and call `Dispose()` manually.

- The `IDisposable` interface provides a standard way to release unmanaged resources deterministically (i.e., at a known time).
- It defines a single method: `void Dispose()`;
- You implement `IDisposable` when your class holds unmanaged resources or references to other `IDisposable` objects.

### How It Works

- The consumer of your class calls `Dispose()` when the object is no longer needed.
- This allows you to free resources immediately, rather than waiting for the GC.

```csharp
class MyClass : IDisposable
{
    // Implementation
}
```

### Best Practices: The Dispose Pattern

```csharp
class MyClass : IDisposable
{
    private bool disposed = false;

    public void Dispose()
    {
        Dispose(true);
        GC.SuppressFinalize(this); // Prevents finalizer from running
    }

    protected virtual void Dispose(bool disposing)
    {
        if (!disposed)
        {
            if (disposing)
            {
                // Free managed resources here
            }
            // Free unmanaged resources here

            disposed = true;
        }
    }

    ~MyClass()
    {
        Dispose(false);
    }
}
```

- If your class owns unmanaged resources directly, implement both a finalizer and `IDisposable`.
- If your class only uses managed resources that themselves implement `IDisposable`, just implement `IDisposable` (no finalizer needed).
- Always call `GC.SuppressFinalize(this)` in `Dispose()` to avoid unnecessary finalization.

---

### 1. Generational Collection (The "Why")

The .NET GC is **generational**, based on the "Infant Mortality" hypothesis: most objects die young.

* **Generation 0 (Gen 0):** Short-lived objects (e.g., local variables). Collections happen frequently and are very fast.
* **Generation 1 (Gen 1):** The "buffer" zone for objects that survived Gen 0.
* **Generation 2 (Gen 2):** Long-lived objects (e.g., static data, singletons). Collections here are "Full GCs," which are expensive and can cause "Stop-the-World" pauses.

> **Interview Tip:** Mention that moving an object from Gen 0 to Gen 2 is expensive because it requires memory copying.

### 2. The LOH (Large Object Heap)

Objects larger than **85,000 bytes** go straight to a special area called the **Large Object Heap (LOH)**.

* **The Problem:** The LOH is not compacted by default (historically). This leads to **fragmentation**, where you have enough total memory, but not enough *contiguous* space for a new large object, causing an `OutOfMemoryException`.
* **Modern C#:** Mention `GCSettings.LargeObjectHeapCompactionMode` if you want to sound like an expert.

### 3. Managed vs. Unmanaged Resources

This links back to your `IDisposable` code.

* **Managed:** Memory handled by the GC (strings, arrays, class instances).
* **Unmanaged:** Resources the OS owns (File handles, Window handles, Network sockets, Database connections).
* **The Link:** The GC *cannot* see unmanaged resources. If you don't call `Dispose()`, the memory for the C# object might be freed, but the OS handle stays open (a "leak").

### 4. GC Flavors (Workstation vs. Server)

FAANG interviews often involve "System Design" elements. You should know:

* **Workstation GC:** Optimized for low latency (responsiveness). Used for desktop apps.
* **Server GC:** Optimized for high throughput. It creates a separate GC heap and thread for **each CPU core**, allowing parallel collection.

By default, a standalone C# console app or desktop app uses Workstation GC. However, if you are running an ASP.NET Core web service, Server GC is usually enabled by default because it is optimized for high-throughput, multi-threaded scenarios.

Here is how it works and how you control it:

1. How to Configure It
You don't change this in your C# code; you change it in your project configuration or environment variables. This allows the same compiled binary to behave differently in Dev vs. Production.

Option A: The Project File (.csproj)

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <ServerGarbageCollection>true</ServerGarbageCollection>
</PropertyGroup>
```

---

To understand the setting, you first have to understand the **LOH problem**:

### 1. The Problem: Fragmentation

Normally, when the Garbage Collector clears out dead objects, it **compacts** the memory—it slides all the surviving objects together so there are no gaps.

However, moving large objects (anything $> 85,000$ bytes) is extremely CPU-intensive. To save performance, the GC historically **never compacted the LOH**. It would just leave "holes" where old objects used to be. Eventually, you could have 1GB of total free memory, but if it’s all in small 10KB holes, you'll get an `OutOfMemoryException` the moment you try to allocate a new 1MB array.

---

### 2. The Solution: `LargeObjectHeapCompactionMode`

Introduced in .NET 4.5.1, this setting allows you to tell the GC: *"The next time you do a full Generation 2 collection, please actually slide the large objects together to fix the holes."*

#### How to use it:

```csharp
GCSettings.LargeObjectHeapCompactionMode = GCLargeObjectHeapCompactionMode.CompactOnce;
GC.Collect(); // Force the collection to happen now

```

---

### 3. Key Interview Facts

If this comes up in an interview, here are the technical nuances you should mention:

* **It is "Sticky" for only one collection:** Notice the enum value is `CompactOnce`. After the GC runs and compacts the LOH, the setting automatically resets to `Default`. You have to opt-in every time you want it to happen.
* **Performance Hit:** Compacting the LOH is a "Stop-the-World" event. It freezes the entire application while it moves those massive chunks of memory. You should only trigger this during "quiet" times in your app's lifecycle.
* **Alternative (Background GC):** Modern .NET (Core/5/6+) has improved background GC, but LOH fragmentation can still happen in long-running services (like a high-traffic web server) that handle many large byte arrays or strings.

---

### Why FAANG cares:

At scale, "Memory Leaks" aren't always about forgetting to delete an object; sometimes they are **Virtual Memory leaks** caused by fragmentation. A service might crash with plenty of RAM available simply because the LOH looks like Swiss cheese.

---

### 5. Common Interview Questions & "Gotchas"

| Question | The Correct Answer |
| --- | --- |
| **Can you force a GC?** | Yes, `GC.Collect()`, but you **should almost never do it** in production. It interferes with the GC's self-tuning logic and triggers expensive Gen 2 collections. |
| **What is a "Memory Leak" in C#?** | Since we have a GC, a leak usually happens when a **static** field or a **long-lived event handler** holds a reference to an object that should be dead. |
| **What is the Finalizer queue?** | Objects with Finalizers (`~MyClass`) stay in memory for *at least* one extra GC cycle because they must be moved to a "freachable" queue to run their cleanup code. |

---

## 6. Logging

- Logging in built-in .NET can be configured inside the `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging` namespace. You can log messages at different levels (Information, Warning, Error, etc.) and output them to various providers (Console, Debug, Files, etc.).

### Microsoft.Extensions.Logging

```csharp
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;

public class MyService
{
    private readonly ILogger<MyService> _logger;

    public MyService(ILogger<MyService> logger)
    {
        _logger = logger;
    }

    public void DoWork()
    {
        _logger.LogInformation("Doing work at {Time}", DateTime.UtcNow);
        _logger.LogWarning("Warning message");
        _logger.LogError("An error occurred");
    }
}
```

`ILogger<MyService> _logger` - here we pass `MyService`, so that service name can be logged to identify from where logs come, and used for log filtering.

When you pass MyService as a type parameter to ILogger<MyService>, the logger uses the fully qualified class name (e.g., MyApp.Services.MyService) as the category for all logs generated by that instance.

### Structured Logging with Serilog

- Logs are sent to Elasticsearch for search and analysis, often via Serilog or ELK stack.
- Serilog is a popular structured logging library for .NET applications. It is designed to make log data more useful, flexible, and easy to analyze, especially in modern distributed and cloud-based systems.
- Traditional logging writes plain text messages. Structured logging captures not just the message, but also key-value pairs (properties) that describe the context of the event. This makes logs easier to search, filter, and analyze—especially when sent to systems like Elasticsearch, Seq, or Splunk.
- A "sink" is a Serilog term for a log destination.
- The `Serilog.Sinks.Elasticsearch` package allows you to send logs directly to Elasticsearch.

```powershell
dotnet add package Serilog.AspNetCore
dotnet add package Serilog.Sinks.Elasticsearch
```

```csharp
using Serilog;
using Serilog.Sinks.Elasticsearch;

var logger = new LoggerConfiguration()
    .Enrich.FromLogContext()
    .WriteTo.Console() // Optional for local debugging
    .WriteTo.Elasticsearch(new ElasticsearchSinkOptions(new Uri("http://localhost:9200")) // Use your Elasticsearch URL
    {
        AutoRegisterTemplate = true,
        IndexFormat = "myapp-logs-{0:yyyy.MM.dd}" // Daily index
    })
    .CreateLogger();

Log.Logger = logger;

// builder.Host.UseSerilog();
```

To implement Splunk logging in .NET Core, you should avoid writing directly to the Splunk API within your application code. Instead, the industry standard is to use **Serilog** with an **Asynchronous Sink**.

This ensures that if Splunk is slow or down, your Web API doesn't hang while waiting to send a log.

---

### 1. The Architecture

There are two main ways to get logs into Splunk:

* **HEC (Http Event Collector):** Your app sends logs directly to a Splunk URL via HTTP/S. (Best for Cloud/Serverless).
* **Universal Forwarder:** Your app writes logs to a local file, and a Splunk agent reads that file and ships it. (Best for high-performance on-prem VMs).

---

### 2. Implementation via HEC (Recommended)

#### Step 1: Install NuGet Packages

You'll need Serilog and the specific Splunk Sink.

```bash
dotnet add package Serilog.AspNetCore
dotnet add package Serilog.Sinks.Splunk

```

#### Step 2: Configure `appsettings.json`

Keep your Splunk URL and **HEC Token** (generated in the Splunk Web UI) out of the code.

```json
{
  "Serilog": {
    "WriteTo": [
      {
        "Name": "EventCollector",
        "Args": {
          "splunkHost": "https://your-splunk-url:8088",
          "eventCollectorToken": "your-hec-token-here",
          "index": "api_logs",
          "sourceType": "json"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}

```

#### Step 3: Setup in `Program.cs`

In .NET 6+, you integrate Serilog into the host builder.

```csharp
using Serilog;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Load Serilog configuration from appsettings
Log.Logger = new LoggerConfiguration()
    .ReadFrom.Configuration(builder.Configuration)
    .CreateLogger();

builder.Host.UseSerilog(); // Replaces default logger with Serilog

var app = builder.Build();
// ... rest of your middleware

```

---

### 3. FAANG Interview "Deep Dive" Points

If you are asked about this in an interview, mention these three optimizations:

#### A. Structured Logging (JSON)

Don't just send strings. Send objects. Splunk is a powerful search engine; if you send a JSON object like `{ "UserId": 123, "Latency": 450 }`, you can immediately run a query in Splunk like `index=api_logs | stats avg(Latency) by UserId`.

#### B. The "Async" Sink

Always emphasize that you use **Asynchronous Sinks**.

> *"I configure the Splunk sink to be asynchronous so that log ingestion latency doesn't impact the Request/Response cycle of the API."*

#### C. Correlation IDs

In a microservices environment, use a **Correlation ID** (often via `Serilog.Enrichers.CorrelationId`). This allows you to trace a single request as it travels through 10 different services by searching for one unique ID in Splunk.

---

### 4. Which one should you use?

| Method | Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **HEC (HTTP)** | Fast setup, no extra software on the server. | Can lose logs if the network or Splunk is down. |
| **File + Forwarder** | Extremely reliable (local disk acts as a buffer). | Requires installing the Splunk Universal Forwarder agent. |

## Serilog

Serilog knows where to send your logs through a concept called **Sinks**. Think of a "Sink" as a specific destination (like a file, a console, or an API) that Serilog is told to "pour" data into.

Here is exactly how the hand-off happens:

### 1. The Configuration (The Map)

When your application starts, Serilog reads your `appsettings.json` or your code-based configuration. Within that configuration, there is a `WriteTo` section.

When you add the `Serilog.Sinks.Splunk` package, it registers a specific "instruction set" in Serilog. When Serilog sees `"Name": "EventCollector"`, it looks up that registered instruction and says, *"Okay, any logs I receive need to be formatted and sent to the Splunk URL provided in the arguments."*

---

### 2. The Internal Pipeline (The Factory)

Serilog operates like an assembly line. When you write `_logger.LogInformation("User {Id} logged in", userId);`, the following happens:

1. **Log Event Creation:** Serilog creates a "LogEvent" object. This isn't just a string; it’s a structured object containing the timestamp, the message template, and the property (`userId = 123`).
2. **Enrichment:** It adds extra data (like MachineName, ThreadId, or CorrelationId).
3. **Filtering:** It checks if the log level (Information) meets the minimum requirement (e.g., Warning).
4. **The Dispatch:** Serilog looks at its list of **Sinks**. If "Splunk" is in that list, it hands the LogEvent to the Splunk Sink.

---

### 3. The Splunk Sink (The Courier)

The Splunk Sink is the "worker" that knows the Splunk language.

* **Formatting:** It converts the LogEvent object into a **Splunk-friendly JSON format** (Hark! This is why it’s called "Structured Logging").
* **Buffering:** To be efficient, it doesn't send one HTTP request per log. It waits until it has a "batch" (e.g., 50 logs) or a certain amount of time has passed.
* **Transmission:** It opens an HTTPS connection to the **HEC (Http Event Collector)** endpoint and "POSTs" that JSON data using your HEC Token as a key to open the door.

---

### 4. FAANG Interview Detail: "The Black Box"

If an interviewer asks, *"What happens if the Splunk Sink fails?"*, you should know about **SelfLog**.

Because Serilog is a logger, it can't really log its own errors to itself (that would cause an infinite loop). You have to enable `Serilog.Debugging.SelfLog` to see why logs aren't reaching Splunk:

```csharp
// Send Serilog's internal errors to the Console so you can see why Splunk is failing
Serilog.Debugging.SelfLog.Enable(msg => Console.WriteLine(msg));

```

### Summary for Interview

> "Serilog uses a **provider-based architecture** where 'Sinks' act as output adapters. By configuring the Splunk Sink with a HEC token and URL, Serilog's internal pipeline dispatches structured LogEvent objects to the sink, which then batches and transmits them via asynchronously over HTTP."

# Asycn Await 

Think of `async` and `await` in C# not as a way to run things faster, but as a way to make your application more efficient by **waiting productively.** In a traditional synchronous world, a thread is like a cook who stands still staring at the toaster until the bread pops up. In an asynchronous world, that cook starts the toaster, goes to chop onions, and only returns to the toast when the buzzer goes off.

---

## The Core Mechanics

When you mark a method with the `async` keyword, you're telling the compiler two things:

1. This method can contain the `await` keyword.
2. The method will be transformed into a **state machine**.

### 1. The "Await" Handshake

When the code hits an `await` expression, it checks if the task is already finished.

* **If finished:** It continues running synchronously (no overhead).
* **If not finished:** It signs up a "callback," captures the current context (like where it was in the code), and **returns control to the caller.**

### 2. The State Machine

The C# compiler secretly transforms your clean code into a complex structure. This structure tracks:

* Where you are in the method.
* The values of your local variables.
* What to do once the awaited task completes.

---

## The Three Return Types

| Return Type | Usage |
| --- | --- |
| **`Task<T>`** | For an async method that returns a value (e.g., a string or object). |
| **`Task`** | For an async method that performs an operation but returns nothing (the async `void`). |
| **`ValueTask<T>`** | A performance optimization for when the result might already be available synchronously. |

> **Warning:** Avoid `async void` except for event handlers. If an exception occurs in an `async void` method, it can crash the entire process because there's no `Task` object to "catch" the error.

---

## Why Use It?

1. **UI Responsiveness:** In desktop or mobile apps, `await` keeps the UI thread free so the app doesn't "freeze" while downloading data.
2. **Scalability:** In web servers (like ASP.NET Core), threads aren't wasted waiting for database queries. One thread can handle thousands of concurrent requests because it’s never sitting idle.

### A Simple Example

```csharp
public async Task<string> GetDataAsync()
{
    // Execution starts here on the caller's thread
    HttpClient client = new HttpClient();

    // The thread is released here to do other work
    string result = await client.GetStringAsync("https://api.example.com");

    // Once the data is back, a thread (not necessarily the same one) 
    // picks up where we left off
    return result;
}

```

---

## Common Pitfalls

* **"Async all the way":** Don't try to call an async method from a sync method using `.Result` or `.Wait()`. This often leads to **deadlocks**, especially in older .NET frameworks.
* **CPU-Bound vs. IO-Bound:** Use `async` for IO (files, network, databases). If you have heavy math, use `Task.Run` to push it to a background thread.

# ValueTask<T>

Think of `ValueTask<T>` as the "high-performance sibling" of the standard `Task<T>`.

While a `Task<T>` is a **reference type** (it lives on the heap and requires memory allocation), a `ValueTask<T>` is a **value type** (a `struct` that lives on the stack).

---

## Why do we need it?

In high-performance scenarios, you might have a method that is *usually* finished immediately but *occasionally* needs to go off and do actual asynchronous work.

If you use `Task<T>` and the data is already available (for example, in a local cache), you are still forced to allocate a `Task` object on the heap just to return that result. If this happens thousands of times per second, the Garbage Collector (GC) has to work overtime to clean them up.

### The Comparison

| Feature | `Task<T>` | `ValueTask<T>` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Type** | Class (Reference Type) | Struct (Value Type) |
| **Allocation** | Always allocated on the heap. | Zero allocation if the result is available synchronously. |
| **Flexibility** | Can be awaited multiple times or stored. | **Strictly** for single-await use cases. |
| **Best For** | General purpose async code. | Tight loops, high-frequency IO, or caching. |

---

## When to Use It

You should consider `ValueTask<T>` when:

1. The method is called **very frequently**.
2. The result is **often available synchronously** (e.g., reading from a buffer or a cache).
3. You want to reduce pressure on the Garbage Collector.

### Code Example: The Caching Pattern

```csharp
private string _cachedData;

public ValueTask<string> GetCityNameAsync()
{
    // If we already have the value, returning a ValueTask is "free" (no heap allocation)
    if (_cachedData != null)
    {
        return new ValueTask<string>(_cachedData);
    }

    // If we don't have it, we fall back to a real Task
    return new ValueTask<string>(FetchCityFromDatabaseAsync());
}

private async Task<string> FetchCityFromDatabaseAsync() 
{ 
    /* database logic */ 
}

```

---

## The "Golden Rules" (The Trade-offs)

Because `ValueTask<T>` is a struct, it has some strict usage rules. Breaking these can lead to unpredictable behavior or race conditions:

* **Never await a `ValueTask` twice.** The underlying object may have been reused by the system after the first await.
* **Don't call `.GetAwaiter().GetResult()**` if the task hasn't finished.
* **Don't use `Task.WhenAll` or `Task.WhenAny**` directly with `ValueTask`. You must convert it first using `.AsTask()`.

---

## Summary

If you are building a standard business application, stick with `Task<T>`. It’s harder to break. But if you are building a high-throughput library, a game engine, or a socket-level networking layer, `ValueTask<T>` is a powerful tool to keep your memory usage lean.

It is the perfect pattern for a "Cache-Aside" strategy.

When you have a cache, 90–99% of your calls are likely "hits." If you use a regular Task<T>, you are allocating a new object on the heap every single time you return that cached value, which is a waste of memory and CPU cycles.

Why this is better
High-Hit Scenarios: If your app handles 10,000 requests per second and has a 95% cache hit rate, using Task<T> would create 9,500 useless objects per second for the Garbage Collector to clean up. ValueTask<T> creates zero.

Caller Simplicity: The person calling GetUserDisplayNameAsync doesn't need to know if it came from the cache or the DB; they just await it as usual.

### Performance Summary
Using ValueTask for a local cache is one of the easiest "free" performance wins in C# development. It makes your code run cooler (less CPU usage) and keeps the managed heap much cleaner.


Think of a `Task` as a **receipt** for a job being done. When you use `async Task`, you hand that receipt back to the caller. If something goes wrong (an exception), the error is written onto that receipt. The caller can then look at the receipt, see the error, and handle it with a `try-catch` block.

When you use `async void`, **there is no receipt.** You are essentially telling the program: "Go do this in the background, and I don't care what happens next."

---

## Why It Crashes the Process

In .NET, exceptions need a place to go. Here is the mechanical difference between how they are handled:

### 1. The `Task` Path (Safe)

When an exception happens in an `async Task` method, the exception is caught by the generated state machine and stored in the `Task` object. It stays there quietly until someone "awaits" that task.

* **Result:** The exception is "contained."

### 2. The `void` Path (Dangerous)

Because there is no `Task` object to hold the exception, the error cannot be captured. It bubbles up to the **SynchronizationContext** (the environment running the code). Since the environment doesn't know how to handle a random background error, it treats it as an **unhandled exception on the process**, which triggers a "fail-fast" mechanism.

* **Result:** The entire application shuts down immediately.

---

## A Comparison Table

| Feature | `async Task` | `async void` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Exception Handling** | Caught and stored in the `Task`. | Re-thrown on the active context (Crashes). |
| **Awaitable?** | Yes. | No. |
| **Trackability** | The caller knows when it's done. | "Fire and forget." Caller has no idea. |
| **Testing** | Easy to unit test. | Very difficult to test. |

---

## The One Exception: Event Handlers

The only reason `async void` exists is to support **Events**. The signature for a button click in C# is fixed:
`private void Button_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)`.

Since the UI framework expects a `void` return type, you are allowed to use `async void` here. However, you must be extremely diligent with your own error handling:

```csharp
// The ONLY acceptable place for async void
private async void SubmitButton_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    try 
    {
        await SaveDataAsync();
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        // You MUST catch the error here, 
        // because there is no Task to catch it for you!
        ShowErrorMessage(ex.Message);
    }
}

```

---

## Summary of the "Crash"

If you call an `async void` method without a `try-catch` inside it, and a network timeout occurs, your app won't just show an error—it will disappear from the user's screen entirely.

# 1. Data Parallelism vs. Task Parallelism

While **Asynchronous Programming** (`async/await`) is about "waiting productively" for IO, **Task Parallelism** is about "doing multiple things at once" by utilizing multiple CPU cores.

In .NET, this is handled by the **Task Parallel Library (TPL)**. Instead of thinking about low-level threads, you think about **Tasks**—units of work that the system schedules for you.

---

There are two main ways to go parallel:

### Data Parallelism

You have one operation (like resizing an image) and you apply it to a massive collection of data. The TPL splits the collection and processes chunks simultaneously.

* **Tool:** `Parallel.ForEach` or `Parallel.For`.
* **Best for:** Processing lists, math-heavy loops, or data migrations.

### Task Parallelism

You have distinct, independent jobs that can run at the same time. For example, generating a PDF report while simultaneously uploading a log file.

* **Tool:** `Task.Run` or `Task.Factory.StartNew`.
* **Best for:** Background operations that don't need to block the main flow.

---

## 2. The Task Scheduler

When you use Task Parallelism, you aren't manually creating threads. You are handing tasks to the **Task Scheduler**, which uses a **ThreadPool**.

* **Work-Stealing:** If one CPU core finishes its tasks early, it will "steal" work from the queues of other busy cores. This keeps all your hardware working at maximum efficiency.
* **Optimization:** The TPL automatically adjusts the number of threads based on your CPU count and current load.

---

## 3. Key Patterns in Task Parallelism

### Running Tasks in Parallel

If you have three independent functions, you can start them all and wait for the "group" to finish.

```csharp
// Start all tasks immediately
Task task1 = DoWorkA();
Task task2 = DoWorkB();
Task task3 = DoWorkC();

// Wait for all of them to complete
await Task.WhenAll(task1, task2, task3); 

```

### The Parallel Class

For CPU-bound loops, `Parallel.ForEach` is the gold standard. It’s significantly faster than a standard `foreach` because it uses all available cores.

```csharp
List<string> filePaths = GetFiles();

Parallel.ForEach(filePaths, (filePath) => {
    // This code runs on multiple threads simultaneously
    ProcessFile(filePath); 
});

```

---

## 4. When to Use Which?

It’s easy to confuse `Task.Run` with `async/await`. Here is the rule of thumb:

| Scenario | Tool | Why? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Waiting for a Database/API** | `async/await` | It's IO-bound. Don't waste a thread. |
| **Heavy Image Processing/Math** | `Task.Run` | It's CPU-bound. Offload it to a background thread. |
| **Looping through 10k items** | `Parallel.ForEach` | It's Data Parallelism. Maximize CPU throughput. |

---

## 5. The Golden Rule: Thread Safety

Task Parallelism introduces the risk of **Race Conditions**. If two tasks try to update the same variable at the same time, your data will be corrupted.

> **Example:** If two parallel tasks perform `counter++` on the same integer, the final result might be lower than expected because they overwrite each other.
> **Solution:** Use `lock` keywords or `System.Collections.Concurrent` (like `ConcurrentDictionary`).

---

# ConfigureAwait(false)

Think of `ConfigureAwait(false)` as a "GPS instruction" for your code. It tells the `.NET` runtime whether it needs to jump back to the **original thread** (the specific context) after an `await` finishes, or if it can just continue on whatever thread is available.

---

## 1. The "Context" Concept

In certain types of applications, the environment cares about which thread is running the code:

* **UI Apps (WPF, WinForms, MAUI):** Only the "UI Thread" can update buttons or text boxes.
* **Legacy ASP.NET (Non-Core):** It uses a `SynchronizationContext` to keep track of things like `HttpContext.Current`.

When you `await` a task, C# normally captures that context. Once the task is done, it forces the code to resume inside that same context.

---

## 2. What `false` Actually Does

By adding `.ConfigureAwait(false)`, you are saying:

> "I don't care about the original context. Once this task is done, just run the rest of the method on any available thread pool thread."

### The Visualization

1. **With `true` (Default):** Thread A starts  Await  Task finishes  **Must find Thread A**  Resume.
2. **With `false`:** Thread A starts  Await  Task finishes  **Any Thread (B, C, or D)**  Resume.

---

## 3. Why Use It? (Two Main Reasons)

### A. Avoiding Deadlocks

This is the most famous reason. In UI or legacy ASP.NET apps, if you block the main thread (e.g., using `.Result` or `.Wait()`) while an `async` method is trying to jump back to that same thread to finish, they will stare at each other forever. `ConfigureAwait(false)` prevents this because the async method doesn't try to jump back to the blocked thread.

### B. Performance

Jumping back to a specific context has a small cost (overhead). For library code or back-end logic that doesn't touch the UI, jumping back is unnecessary. Using `false` makes the code slightly faster and more efficient by staying on the thread pool.

---

## 4. When to Use It vs. When Not To

| Scenario | Use `ConfigureAwait(false)`? |
| --- | --- |
| **Library Code** (NuGet packages, shared logic) | **Yes, always.** You don't know if the caller is a UI app or a console app. |
| **App Logic** (Calculation, Data Processing) | **Yes.** It's cleaner and more performant. |
| **UI Updates** (Updating a Label or ProgressBar) | **No.** If you use `false`, you'll get a "Cross-thread operation not valid" error. |
| **ASP.NET Core** | **Optional.** Modern ASP.NET Core doesn't have a `SynchronizationContext`, so `false` technically does nothing (but people still use it in libraries for compatibility). |

---

## 5. The Modern Reality

In **ASP.NET Core**, the `SynchronizationContext` was removed. This means the "Deadlock" risk is mostly gone in web apps. However, if you are writing a library that might be used in a **WPF** or **WinForms** app, you **must** still use `.ConfigureAwait(false)` to be a "good citizen."

### Code Example

```csharp
public async Task<byte[]> DownloadDataAsync(string url)
{
    var client = new HttpClient();
    
    // We don't need the UI context to process bytes, 
    // so we use false to stay on the thread pool.
    var data = await client.GetByteArrayAsync(url).ConfigureAwait(false);
    
    return data;
}

```

**Pro Tip:** In modern C#, if you find yourself writing `.ConfigureAwait(false)` on every single line, there are Visual Studio extensions (like "ConfigureAwait.Fody") that can apply it to your entire project automatically!

In a WPF application, if you are planning to update a UI element (like a Label, TextBox, or DataGrid) immediately after the await line, you should not use ConfigureAwait(false). You should either leave it at the default (which is true) or explicitly use ConfigureAwait(true).

The Short Answer: Keep it true
You need the SynchronizationContext to stay on the UI Thread.

# FAANG Interview Questions: C# Async Deep Dive

FAANG interviews (Google, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft) rarely ask for simple definitions. They want to see if you understand the memory implications, thread-pool mechanics, and distributed system safety of your code.

Here are the high-frequency interview questions for C# async at the FAANG level, categorized by depth.

## 1. The Architectural "Deep Dive"

### Question: "Explain the state machine generated by the compiler when you use async. How does it track variables and the execution point?"

**What they're looking for:** Knowledge of the `IAsyncStateMachine`. You should mention that local variables are moved to fields in a hidden struct or class to preserve state across thread hops.

**Bonus:** Explain that the first part of an async method often runs synchronously until the first "incomplete" await is hit.

### Question: "What is the difference between Task and ValueTask? When would you use one over the other?"

**The Answer:** Task is a class (heap allocation). ValueTask is a struct (stack/inline).

**The FAANG Twist:** If a method often returns a result synchronously (e.g., from a cache), ValueTask prevents a garbage collection (GC) allocation on every call. Use Task for most cases; use ValueTask in high-throughput hot paths.

## 2. Pitfalls & Performance

### Question: "What happens if you have a massive loop of await Task.WhenAll(...)? How do you prevent Thread Pool Starvation?"

**The Scenario:** You trigger 10,000 API calls at once.

**The Solution:** Discuss throttling. Explain how to use `SemaphoreSlim` to limit concurrent tasks so you don't overwhelm the system or exhaust the thread pool.

### Question: "Explain ConfigureAwait(false). Why is it critical for library authors but less important in modern ASP.NET Core?"

**The Answer:** It prevents capturing the `SynchronizationContext`.

**The Depth:** In legacy UI apps (WPF/WinForms), it prevents deadlocks. In ASP.NET Core (3.1+), the `SynchronizationContext` was removed, but library authors still use it to save a tiny bit of performance by avoiding unnecessary context hops.

## 3. Concurrency & Reliability

### Question: "How do you handle exceptions in Task.WhenAll? If three tasks fail, which exception do you see in the catch block?"

**The Answer:** Awaiting `Task.WhenAll` only throws the first exception encountered.

**The FAANG Twist:** To see all errors, you must inspect the `Task.Exception` property, which contains an `AggregateException` with the full list of `InnerExceptions`.

### Question: "Can you use a lock inside an async method? If not, what is the alternative?"

**The Answer:** No, `lock` is thread-affine (it expects the same thread to exit as entered). `await` breaks this.

**The Alternative:** `SemaphoreSlim.WaitAsync()`.

## 4. Coding Scenarios (LeetCode Style)

You might be asked to implement a "Retry" mechanism or a "Timeout" wrapper.

- **Retry:** How to use a loop with `await Task.Delay(ms)` and exponential backoff.
- **Timeout:** Using `Task.WhenAny(originalTask, Task.Delay(timeout))` to implement a manual timeout.

## Summary Table: Quick FAANG Prep

| Topic | Critical Keywords | Memory |
|-------|-------------------|---------|
| **State Machine** | `IAsyncStateMachine`, compiler-generated struct | ValueTask, GC overhead, state machine structs |
| **Deadlocks** | `ConfigureAwait(false)`, Blocking calls (`.Result`) | Deadlocks, SynchronizationContext |
| **Throughput** | `Task.WhenAll`, `SemaphoreSlim`, Thread Pool | Thread Pool Starvation, throttling |
| **Return Types** | `async Task` (Yes), `async void` (Crash risk) | Exception handling, process crashes |

| **Throughput** | `Task.WhenAll`, `SemaphoreSlim`, Thread Pool | Thread Pool Starvation, throttling |
| **Return Types** | `async Task` (Yes), `async void` (Crash risk) | Exception handling, process crashes |


This is a classic "Senior Engineer" question because it tests whether you understand that **asynchronous** doesn't mean **infinite**. Even though `async` is efficient, every task still has a cost in memory and management.

---

## 1. The Problem: "The Firehose Effect"

If you have 10,000 items and you do this:

```csharp
var tasks = items.Select(i => ProcessAsync(i));
await Task.WhenAll(tasks);

```

You aren't "waiting" for 10,000 things; you are **starting** 10,000 things simultaneously.

### Why this causes "Starvation":

1. **Memory Pressure:** Each `Task` creates an object on the heap. Each `async` state machine stores local variables. 10,000 of these can lead to massive GC (Garbage Collection) pressure.
2. **Socket/Resource Exhaustion:** If those tasks are API calls, you will likely hit the outbound connection limit or "Socket Exhaustion," causing many requests to fail before they even leave your machine.
3. **Thread Pool Injection:** While `await` doesn't block a thread, the *continuation* (the code after the `await`) needs a thread to run on. If 10,000 tasks finish at nearly the same time, the Thread Pool is flooded with 10,000 "work items." The pool tries to spin up new threads to keep up, causing a CPU spike just from thread management.

---

## 2. The Solution: Throttling (The "Funnel")

In a FAANG interview, the expected answer is to **throttle concurrency**. You want to process the 10,000 items, but only **N** at a time (e.g., 50 at a time).

### Strategy A: Using `SemaphoreSlim` (The Pro Way)

This is the most flexible approach. The semaphore acts as a gatekeeper.

```csharp
public async Task ProcessWithThrottle(IEnumerable<Item> items, int maxConcurrency)
{
    using var semaphore = new SemaphoreSlim(maxConcurrency);
    var tasks = items.Select(async item =>
    {
        await semaphore.WaitAsync(); // Request entry
        try
        {
            await ProcessAsync(item);
        }
        finally
        {
            semaphore.Release(); // Open the gate for the next one
        }
    });

    await Task.WhenAll(tasks);
}

```

### Strategy B: `Parallel.ForEachAsync` (The Modern Way)

Introduced in .NET 6, this is now the standard recommendation. It handles the orchestration and throttling for you.

```csharp
var options = new ParallelOptions { MaxDegreeOfParallelism = 50 };

await Parallel.ForEachAsync(items, options, async (item, token) =>
{
    await ProcessAsync(item);
});

```

---

## 3. Key Concepts to Mention

| Term | Interview Definition |
| --- | --- |
| **Throughput vs. Latency** | Throttling might increase the *latency* of a single item, but it increases the *throughput* and stability of the entire system. |
| **Backpressure** | By limiting concurrency, you are applying "backpressure" to your own system, ensuring you don't overwhelm downstream databases or APIs. |
| **Task.Yield()** | Mentioning this shows you understand how to break up long-running synchronous work to let the thread pool breathe. |

---

## The FAANG Follow-up:

*"What if the items are coming from a continuous stream (like Kafka) rather than a fixed list?"*

This is where you would mention **Dataflow (TPL Dataflow)** or **System.Threading.Channels**. These libraries allow you to create a "pipeline" where one part of your code produces work and another part consumes it at a controlled rate.

# state machine

To answer this at a FAANG-level, you have to move past "syntactic sugar" and talk about **low-level IL (Intermediate Language) transformation**. When you mark a method as `async`, the compiler doesn't just "run it in the background"—it completely deconstructs your method.

---

## 1. The Transformation: From Method to Struct

The compiler generates a hidden **`struct`** (for performance, to avoid heap allocation if the task completes synchronously) that implements the `IAsyncStateMachine` interface.

Your original code is moved into a method called `MoveNext()`.

### The Anatomy of the State Machine

* **The State Field:** An integer (usually `_state`) that tracks where you are.
* `-1`: Not started or currently running.
* `0, 1, 2...`: Suspended, waiting for a specific `await`.
* `-2`: Finished (Success or Faulted).


* **Hoisted Variables:** Every local variable and parameter from your original method is "hoisted" into a **field** on this struct. This is how the method "remembers" its data after it returns control to the caller.
* **The Builder:** A `AsyncTaskMethodBuilder` which manages the creation of the `Task` and the completion logic.

---

## 2. How the Execution Point is Tracked

The secret is the **`MoveNext()`** method and the **`await`** jump table.

### Step-by-Step Execution:

1. **Entry:** You call the method. The state machine is initialized, and `MoveNext()` is called.
2. **The Hit:** Code runs until it hits an `await`.
3. **The Check:** The machine checks the "awaiter" (`GetAwaiter().IsCompleted`).
* **If Completed:** It continues running synchronously (no suspension).
* **If NOT Completed:** * The `_state` is updated to a non-negative number (e.g., `0`).
* The machine calls `OnCompleted`, passing **itself** as the callback.
* **The method returns.** The thread is now free to do other work.




4. **The Resume:** When the awaited task finishes, it triggers the callback. This calls `MoveNext()` again.
5. **The Jump:** Inside `MoveNext()`, there is a big `switch(_state)` statement. It sees `state == 0` and jumps directly to the code immediately following the `await`.

---

## 3. Memory & Performance Implications (FAANG Depth)

Interviewers will often pivot here to ask about **allocations**.

* **Struct vs. Class:** Why a `struct`? If the method completes synchronously (e.g., data was in cache), the state machine stays on the stack, and **zero heap memory** is allocated for the state machine itself.
* **Boxing:** If the method *must* yield (suspend), the state machine is "boxed" onto the heap so its data survives until the task resumes.
* **Context:** The state machine also captures the `ExecutionContext` (security, culture, etc.) to ensure that when the code resumes, it feels like it’s in the same environment.

---

## The "Pro" Summary

"The `async` keyword triggers a transformation where the method becomes a state machine struct. Local variables are hoisted to fields, and the method logic is moved into a `MoveNext` loop. This allows the method to suspend by returning control to the caller and later resume at a specific jump-point when the awaited task notifies the machine of completion."
